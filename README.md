Inject Challenge (Rubyist Badge)
================

Overview
-------

* This is a rewrite of the "inject()" ruby method called "my_inject", where I have tried to rewrite the method manually.

Completing The Task
-----

* The first step was spending a lot of time figuring out what the inject method did and more importantly how it did that so I could implement it myself.
* After figuring that out I created a basic model which worked with simple block adding numbers together.
* Next I needed to initialize with a nill value if no argument was given by the user, the meant that I had to change my "0" value to "nil" and change the nil to the appropriate class.
* Then it was just a matter of testing various blocks to see if I got the correct answer.
