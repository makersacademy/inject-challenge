Inject Challenge (Rubyist Badge)
================

Instructions
-------

* Challenge time: Friday, the entire day + the weekend if you need it
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your challenge solution by 9am Monday morning

Task
-----

* Fill out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan
* Fork this repo
* Reopen the Array class or subclass it.
* Rewrite the inject method. Write a test for it first. Don't worry about returning an enumerator, assume a block is always given
* Name your method differently (that is, not inject() or subclass Array) because rspec uses inject() internally, so the tests will fail with weird messages unless your implementation of inject is perfect.
* If you would like a challenge, rewrite inject using two approaches: using iterators and using recursion but itâ€™s not required to pass.
* Submit pull request with your solution


(from ruby core)
=== Implementation from Enumerable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  enum.inject(initial, sym) -> obj
  enum.inject(sym)          -> obj
  enum.inject(initial) { |memo, obj| block }  -> obj
  enum.inject          { |memo, obj| block }  -> obj

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combines all elements of enum by applying a binary operation,
specified by a block or a symbol that names a method or operator.

If you specify a block, then for each element in enum the block is
passed an accumulator value (memo) and the element. If you specify a
symbol instead, then each element in the collection will be passed to the
named method of memo. In either case, the result becomes the new value
for memo. At the end of the iteration, the final value of memo
is the return value for the method.

If you do not explicitly specify an initial value for
memo, then the first element of collection is used as the initial
