Inject Challenge
================

About
-------

An afternoon challenge to rewrite Ruby's inject method, using TDD.

How to contribute?
-----

I'm afraid this is just a little personal challenge to test my progress this week.

However, if you have any comments or advice please feel free to comment.

How to use?
-----

Download the file in lib and 'require' it into your project.

You can also download the full repo and run 'rake' in the root, if you'd like to run tests.

Future Additions
-----

I may return to this and implement the same functionality using recursion rather than '.each'! :)

Thanks for reading,

Dan
