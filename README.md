Inject Challenge (Rubyist Badge)
================

Approach
--------
I've created two methods (my_inject and my_inject_rec) which recreate inject's functionality. The first works iteratively and the second recursively.

Instructions
-------

* Challenge time: Friday, the entire day + the weekend if you need it
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your challenge solution by 9am Monday morning

Task
-----

* Fill out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan
* Fork this repo
* run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Reopen the Array class or subclass it.
* Rewrite the inject method. Write a test for it first. Don't worry about returning an enumerator, assume a block is always given
* Name your method differently (that is, not inject() or subclass Array) because rspec uses inject() internally, so the tests will fail with weird messages unless your implementation of inject is perfect.
* If you would like a challenge, rewrite inject using two approaches: using iterators and using recursion but itâ€™s not required to pass.
* Submit pull request with your solution
