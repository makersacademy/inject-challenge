Inject Challenge (Rubyist Badge)
================

My solution to the Inject Challenge.

I have submitted two solutions - one which solves using iterators and one which uses recursion. The recursive solution is not yet perfect as it cannot deal with symbols only currently.

I had to create two extra methods because RuboCop felt the method was too long otherwise - obviously this would make them accessible to the whole of the ```Array``` class which is not desirable but in the real world they would probably just be part of the normal method.
