I have created a basic injection method that will allow the user to pass in an array of numbers that can then be added, substracted, divided, multiplied, divided and return the remainer and finally square numbers to a desired power.
This will work for both block and symbol methods, however, currently it doesn't work with any starting point that isn't zero.
