The Inject Challenge

A new class called My_Array was created. 
It inherited all the information from the Array class, so that the method created for this challenge could be compared to the inject method. 
The method created is called 'challenge'.
It takes one argument and returns the result of executing a block given with the method over every element of the array. 
In the feature test both the inject and challenge method were called over the same array and the same result was given.
